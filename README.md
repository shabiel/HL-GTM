# HL7 and HLO for GT.M/YottaDB
This codebase provides HL7 support for GT.M and YottaDB. There is one small
change in the regular HL7 package, and many modifications for HLO. I am
grateful to Lloyd Milligan for doing the initial port for HLO. This work builds
upon his initial work, and adds some new features for the port.

More documentation forthcoming in the future.
